I have learnt a lot this term, starting with one dimensional sound, moving on to
two dimensional graphics and then to three dimensional space. I am particularly
interested in 3D and realise the power of 3D engines, so I have chosen to use the
three.js 3d library to create my final project. I started the project by creating a scene based on the three. js official
documentation, which included a Scene, a Perspective Camera and a renderer. To
build a 3D world I need a skybox, so I created a cube to act as a mapping container
and applied textures to six faces respectively. I also added an ambient light to the
world to create natural lighting. My idea was to create a park with a statue from an
alien planet in the centre. Thus, I created a sphere, which I used standard material to
give it a certain metallic look. I hoped this would leave people an impression of alien
beings watching over the Earth. Then, I made it reflect the scenery of the whole park
through texture mapping. Since a sphere is too monotonous, I created a torusknot to
orbit it. This time I used normal material, and the rainbow colours made it seem like it
came from beyond Earth. To make them more alien, I created an animation function
to make the sphere and the Torusknot spin. In addition, I wanted to make them float
on water, like the sculptures on the pond in the park, so I called the water file in
three.js. However, probably due to the version of the library I used, I didn't succeed in
getting the water to move. Instead, I created a mirror with water texture that reflected
my statue and the whole world. I kept the water and hope to try something else to
solve this problem over the winter break. I also considered the sound, as it is in a park
and can't just have a view with no sound. Therefore, I referred to the three.js
documentation and added bird song to my park. A 3D world certainly can't lack
interactivity! Hence, I created three mouse events to enable interaction with the whole
skybox and my alien sculpture. Firstly, I listened to the right mouse button to control
the rotation of the whole world and the water surface. Secondly, I listened to the
wheel of the mouse to control the zooming in and out of the sphere and torusknot. Thirdly, I listened to my left mouse button. By clicking on the sphere or torusknot
with the left mouse button and holding it, people can drag them anywhere in the park. These are my projects, which impressed upon me that the 3d engine is super
amazing and inspired my curiosity to continue exploring afterwards.
